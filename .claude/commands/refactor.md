description: Refactor code maintaining architecture and tests
---

I will refactor the code following project principles.

**Process:**
1. ✅ Run current tests to ensure they pass
2. 🔍 Analyze code looking for:
   - Hexagonal architecture violations
   - Duplicate code
   - Misplaced responsibilities
   - Anemic entities
   - High coupling
   - Missing validations
3. 🛠️ Refactor while maintaining:
   - Strict hexagonal architecture
   - DDD patterns
   - Layer separation
   - Tests passing at all times
4. ✅ Verify all tests still pass
5. 📝 Document changes made

**Won't break:**
- Architecture layers
- Existing tests
- Public interfaces (unless necessary)

What code do you want me to refactor?
