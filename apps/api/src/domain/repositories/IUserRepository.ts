/**
 * User Repository Interface (PORT)
 *
 * This is a PORT in Hexagonal Architecture:
 * - Defined in the DOMAIN layer
 * - Implemented in the INFRASTRUCTURE layer
 * - Describes WHAT operations are needed, not HOW they're implemented
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Domain layer doesn't depend on database technology
 * - Easy to swap implementations (Drizzle → Prisma → TypeORM)
 * - Easy to mock for testing
 * - Follows Dependency Inversion Principle (SOLID)
 *
 * The domain defines the contract, infrastructure implements it.
